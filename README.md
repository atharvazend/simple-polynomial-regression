# About the data set

The dataset captures the relationship between temperature and ice cream sales. It serves as a practical example for understanding and implementing polynomial regression, a powerful technique for modeling nonlinear relationships in data.

The dataset aims to provide insights into relationship between temperature and ice cream sales and apply polynomial regression techniques to predict the number of ice cream units sold based on temperature


# About the code
Here, I used jupyter notebook for python coding language. I used libraries like sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy and pandas for regression analysis
